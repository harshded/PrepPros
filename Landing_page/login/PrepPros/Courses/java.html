										<p>
											Welcome to the Advanced course of Java for placement!</p>

										<p>During this course, you will learn the algorithms and object-oriented
											programming
											through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive
											materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested
											using
											our automatic testing service of MCQs and codes.</p>

										Anyone can join - but previous basic java programming knowledge is required.

										<p>Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged;
											the
											course’s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to
											Programming
											and Advanced Programming courses.</p>

										<p>This is the first course in our computer science learning track, and we use
											industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about
											programming in
											a real integrated development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an
											educational IDE.</p>

										<p>The course does not require separate registration. You can simply dive into
											the
											first part of the course found over here.</p>

										Course Contents
										The course is split up into 4 modules: Java Programming I and Java Programming
										II.
										Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing
										a
										single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and we recommend reserving at least
										10
										hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.

									<div class="w-100 mb-4 mb-md-0"> Servlets are the Java programs that run on the
										Java-enabled web server or application server.
										They are used to handle the request obtained from the web server, process the
										request, produce
										the response, and then send a response back to the web server.

										The properties of Servlets are as follows:
                                      <ul>

										 <li> Servlets work on the server side.</li>
                                         <li>Servlets are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the web server.</li>
									  </ul>
										  Servlet Architecture can be depicted from the image itself as provided below as
										  follows:
                                        <img class="hero-wrap" src="images/servlet.webp">

										Servlet Architecture

										<p>Execution of Servlets basically involves six basic steps:</p>
									  	<ul>

											  <li> clients send the request to the webserver.</li>
										      <li>The web server receives the request.</li>
											  <li>The web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet.</li>
											  <li>The servlet processes the request and generates the response in the form of
											  output.</li>
											  <li>The servlet sends the response back to the webserver.</li>
											  <li>The web server sends the response back to the client and the client browser
											  displays it on the screen.</li>
											</ul>

										<p>Now let us do discuss eccentric point that why do we need For Server-Side
										extensions?</p>

										<p>The <strong> server-side extensions </strong> are nothing but the technologies that are used to
										create dynamic Web
										pages. Actually, to provide the facility of dynamic Web pages, Web pages need a
										container or Web
										server. To meet this requirement, independent Web server providers offer some
										proprietary
										solutions in the form of <strong> APIs </strong> (Application Programming Interface).</p>
										
										<p>These <b>APIs</b> allow us to build programs that can run with a Web server. In this
										case, Java Servlet
										is also one of the component APIs of <b>Java Platform Enterprise Edition (nowadays
										known as –
										‘Jakarta EE’)</b> which sets standards for creating dynamic Web applications in
										Java.</p>

										<p>Before learning about something, it’s important to know the need for that
										something, it’s not
										like that this is the only technology available for creating dynamic Web pages.
										The Servlet
										technology is similar to other Web server extensions such as Common Gateway
										Interface (CGI)
										scripts and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). However, Java Servlets are more
										acceptable since they
										solve the limitations of CGI such as low performance and low degree scalability.</p>

										<b>What is CGI?</b><br>

										<p>CGI is actually an external application that is written by using any of the
										programming
										languages like C or C++ and this is responsible for processing client requests
										and generating
										dynamic content.
										In CGI application, when a client makes a request to access dynamic Web pages,
										the Web server
										performs the following operations:</p>
                                        <ul>
											<li>It first locates the requested web page i.e the required CGI application using
											URL.</li>
											<li>It then creates a new process to service the client’s request.</li>
											<li>Invokes the CGI application within the process and passes the request
											information to the
											application.</li>
											<li>Collects the response from the CGI application.</li>
											<li>Destroys the process, prepares the HTTP response, and sends it to the client.</li>
											<li>Common Gateway Interface Processing</li>
										</ul>

										<p>So, in CGI server has to create and destroy the process for every request. It’s
										easy to
										understand that this approach is applicable for handling few clients but as the
										number of
										clients increases, the workload on the server increases and so the time is taken
										to process
										requests increases.</p>

										<p>Difference between Servlet and CGI</p>
                                        <img class="hero-wrap" src="images/difference.png">
										
										Servlets API’s:
										Servlets are built from two packages:

										javax.servlet(Basic)
										javax.servlet.http(Advance)
										Various classes and interfaces present in these packages are:

										Component Type Package
										Servlet Interface javax.servlet.*
										ServletRequest Interface javax.servlet.*
										ServletResponse Interface javax.servlet.*
										GenericServlet Class javax.servlet.*
										HttpServlet Class javax.servlet.http.*
										HttpServletRequest Interface javax.servlet.http.*
										HttpServletResponse Interface javax.servlet.http.*
										Filter Interface javax.servlet.*
										ServletConfig Interface javax.servlet.*
										Advantages of a Java Servlet
										Servlet is faster than CGI as it doesn’t involve the creation of a new process
										for every new
										request received.
										Servlets, as written in Java, are platform independent.
										Removes the overhead of creating a new process for each request as Servlet
										doesn’t run in a
										separate process. There is only a single instance that handles all requests
										concurrently. This
										also saves the memory and allows a Servlet to easily manage the client state.
										It is a server-side component, so Servlet inherits the security provided by the
										Web server.
										The API designed for Java Servlet automatically acquires the advantages of the
										Java platforms
										such as platform-independent and portability. In addition, it obviously can use
										the wide range
										of APIs created on Java platforms such as JDBC to access the database.
										Many Web servers that are suitable for personal use or low-traffic websites are
										offered for free
										or at extremely cheap costs eg. Java servlet. However, the majority of
										commercial-grade Web
										servers are rather expensive, with the notable exception of Apache, which is
										free.
										The Servlet Container
										Servlet container, also known as Servlet engine, is an integrated set of objects
										that provide a
										run time environment for Java Servlet components. In simple words, it is a
										system that manages
										Java Servlet components on top of the Web server to handle the Web client
										requests.

										Services provided by the Servlet container:

										Network Services: Loads a Servlet class. The loading may be from a local file
										system, a remote
										file system or other network services. The Servlet container provides the
										network services over
										which the request and response are sent.
										Decode and Encode MIME-based messages: Provides the service of decoding and
										encoding MIME-based
										messages.
										Manage Servlet container: Manages the lifecycle of a Servlet.
										Resource management Manages the static and dynamic resources, such as HTML
										files, Servlets, and
										JSP pages.
										Security Service: Handles authorization and authentication of resource access.
										Session Management: Maintains a session by appending a session ID to the URL
										path.
										Conclusion
										Java Servlets are crucial components for defining business logic and handling
										complex web
										requests. These components promote the dynamic development of a web site and has
										a lot of
										potential to change the application dynamics. Here are some of the key features
										we learn in this
										article:

										Java Servlets aids in the development of server-side application development and
										provide a way
										to deal with dynamic content to build robust and interactive websites.
										As soon as the request reaches the web server, a servlet instance is initialized
										using init()
										method, and the HTTP request depending on its type can be handled by doGet() or
										doPost()
										methods.
										Servlets make our web application more responsive and efficient as it doesn’t
										create and destroy
										a process every time a request is received.

        <p>
          Welcome to the Advanced course of Java for placement!</p>

        <p>During this course, you will learn the algorithms and object-oriented
          programming
          through the Java programming language. The course includes comprehensive
          materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested
          using
          our automatic testing service of MCQs and codes.</p>

        Anyone can join - but previous basic java programming knowledge is required.

        <p>Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged;
          the
          courseâ€™s scope and material are identical to our CS1 Introduction to
          Programming
          and Advanced Programming courses.</p>

        <p>This is the first course in our computer science learning track, and we use
          industry-grade tooling from day one. As such, the course is about
          programming in
          a real integrated development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an
          educational IDE.</p>

        <p>The course does not require separate registration. You can simply dive into
          the
          first part of the course found over here.</p>

        Course Contents
        The course is split up into 4 modules: Java Programming I and Java Programming
        II.
        Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set. Completing
        a
        single part takes approximately 5-20 hours, and we recommend reserving at least
        10
        hours per part, depending on prior skills with computers.

A general purpose language is a language that is widely used in various domains and not specific to a particular domain. <strong>C programming language was created in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T bell laboratories in U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Founder:</strong><br>
Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of C programming language.</p>
<p><strong>Early developments:</strong><br>
Ken Thompson wanted to develop a Fortran compiler but later gave up on that idea and shifted his focus to develop an advanced version of BCPL system programming language. He made modifications in the syntax and made it much simple, he named this language as ‘B programming language’.</p>
<p>In 1971, Dennis Ritchie started to improve the features of B language, <strong>by 1972 he was able to write a new modified compiler which he renamed to ‘C’.</strong> C language is a successor of ‘B programming language’. The B programming language didn’t gain as much popularity as ‘C programming language did’. C language developed to overcome the issues and shortcomings of the previous programming languages such as B, BCPL etc.</p>
<p><strong>Popularity:</strong><br>
Since 2000, C programming language consistently ranked among top two languages in <strong>TIOBE index</strong>, an index that measure the popularity of a programming language.</p>
<p><strong>Programming language developed before C:</strong><br>
<strong>ALGOL:</strong> ALGOL (short form of Algorithmic language) is a family of imperative computer programming languages originally developed in 1958.<br>
<strong>BCPL:</strong> BCPL is a procedural, imperative, and structured programming language. It was originally created for writing compilers for other programming languages. BCPL is no longer in common use. It was developed by Martin Richards.<br>
<strong>B:</strong> It was developed by Ken Thompson in 1970. This is known as the predecessor of ‘C’ programming language.<br>
<strong>Traditional C:</strong> It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.<br>
<strong>K&amp;R C:</strong> It was developed by Kernighan &amp; Dennis Ritchie in 1978.<br>
<strong>ANSI C:</strong> It was developed by ANSI Committee in 1989. It is also referred as ‘C89’ and ‘C90’.<br>
<strong>ANSI/ISO C:</strong> Developed in 1990 by ISO Committee.<br>
<strong>C99:</strong> Developed in 1990 by Standardization Committee. It is a revised version of C.</p>

<h2>Features of C language</h2>
<p><strong>1. Simple</strong><br>
C language is simple and easy to learn. The syntax of C is simple and gives flexibility to the programmer with its wide variety of in-built functions and data types.</p>
<p><strong>2. Portable</strong><br>
C is a machine independent language, which means a C program written one machine can run on another machine without requiring a code change.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fast</strong><br>
C is a compiler based language. C is power packed with several features but it is not bloated like some other programming languages, it supports only useful features which makes the <strong>compilation of C file fast</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Extensible</strong><br>
C program supports code modifications and addition of new code to the already existing programs, this makes C language extensible. It becomes <strong>easier to add new functionalities to the existing C programs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rich libraries:</strong><br>
C libraries are full of useful in-built functions. These functions can be used frequently to perform some repeated tasks. As a C programmer, you won’t need to write same code again and again for some trivial repeated tasks, rather you can use in-built functions to perform the task.</p>
<p><strong>6. Dynamic memory allocation</strong><br>
Dynamic memory allocation means, optimizing and allocating the memory during runtime. C language supports dynamic memory allocation, which supports function like <strong>free()</strong> to free the un-utilized memory space and other <strong>memory management functions such as malloc(), calloc()</strong> etc.</p>
<p><strong>7. Reusability</strong><br>
Function is a block of code that is used to perform a specific task. Along with the in-built predefined functions, C language allows you to create you own functions that you can create for a reoccurring tasks. This improves the reusability of the code and avoids the unnecessary writing of the same code again and again.</p>
<p><strong>8. Mid level programming language</strong><br>
C language provides the benefits of high level and low-level languages both. C allows manipulation of hardware just like low level language and allows high user end functionalities like high-level languages.</p>
<p><strong>9. Supports pointers</strong><br>
C language supports pointers. The pointer in C allows you to directly interact with the memory.</p>
<p><strong>10. Recursion</strong><br>
C supports recursion. Recursion means a function calls itself. Recursion provides the features of code reusability and backtracking.</p>

                    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>

                    <h2>Features of Python Programming Language</h2>
                    <img class="hero-wrap" src="../../images/why-python.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Readable: Python is a very readable language.</li>
                        <li>Easy to Learn: Learning Python is easy as it is an expressive and high-level programming language, which means it is easy to understand the language and thus easy to learn.</li>
                        <li>Cross-platform: Python is available and can run on various operating systems such as Mac, Windows, Linux, Unix, etc. This makes it a cross-platform and portable language.</li>
                        <li>Open Source: Python is an open-source programming language.</li>
                        <li>Large Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that has some handy codes and functions which we can use while writing code in Python.</li>
                        <li>Free: Python is free to download and use. This means you can download it for free and use it in your application. Python is an example of a FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software), which means you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, and modify it.</li>
                        <li>Supports Exception Handling: Python supports exception handling, which means we can write less error-prone code and can test various scenarios that can cause an exception later on.</li>
                        <li>Advanced Features: Python supports advanced features like generators and list comprehensions.</li>
                        <li>Automatic Memory Management: Python supports automatic memory management, which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the memory.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>What Can You Do with Python?</h2>
                    <p>Python has a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Web development – Web framework like Django and Flask are based on Python. They help you write server side code which helps you manage database, write backend programming logic, mapping urls etc.</li>
                        <li>Machine learning – There are many machine learning applications written in Python. Machine learning is a way to write a logic so that a machine can learn and solve a particular problem on its own. For example, products recommendation in websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc. is a machine learning algorithm that recognises user’s interest. Face recognition and Voice recognition in your phone is another example of machine learning.</li>
                        <li>Data Analysis – Data analysis and data visualisation in form of charts can also be developed using Python.</li>
                        <li>Scripting – Scripting is writing small programs to automate simple tasks such as sending automated response emails etc. Such type of applications can also be written in Python programming language.</li>
                        <li>Desktop GUI applications - Python can be used to develop desktop applications using libraries like Tkinter.</li>
                        <li>Game development - Python offers libraries like Pygame for developing games.</li>
                        <li>Embedded applications - Python can be used in embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) projects.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Python is a versatile programming language with a wide range of applications. Its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support make it a popular choice among developers for various projects.</p>
